# mini-language-interpreter
This project implements an interpreter for a tiny block-structured language. It includes a hand-written lexer and parser that build an abstract syntax tree (AST), plus an evaluator that executes SBML programs with variables, arithmetic expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic semantic error checking.
